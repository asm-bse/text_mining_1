# text_mining_1


Now we need to decide:
- Dates
- Control City
- What data (apart from text description) we want to get for each hotel (in 3c we need "hotel quality" so we should add stars may be, we need hotel name as well, maybe something else?)

I have no idea about stopwords and wordclouds. Shall we wait for another class before doint steps 2 and 3?
